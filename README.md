On this project we shall be working with Binary trees. Binary trees are a type of tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, typically referred to as the "left child" and the "right child." In a binary tree, every node can have either zero, one, or two children. Each node in the tree represents a data element, and the connections between nodes represent the relationships between those data elements.
Binary trees have the following properties:
    - Root: The topmost node in the binary tree is called the root node. There is only one root node in a binary tree.
    - Parent and Child Nodes: Each node (except the root) in a binary tree has exactly one parent node, which is the node directly above it. A node with children is called a "parent" node, and the nodes directly below it are its "child" nodes.
    - Leaf Nodes: Nodes that have no children are called leaf nodes or external nodes. They are the nodes with no children.
    - Internal Nodes: Nodes with at least one child are called internal nodes.
    - Depth: The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root node to that node. The depth of the root node is 0.
    - Height: The height of a binary tree is the maximum depth of any node in the tree. It is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf node.

Binary trees are commonly used in computer science and programming for various applications, such as representing hierarchical data structures, binary search trees (BSTs) for efficient data retrieval, and expression trees for evaluating mathematical expressions. They offer a simple yet powerful way to organize and manipulate data efficiently, especially when the data exhibits hierarchical relationships.
